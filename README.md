<h1 align="center"> VOLTAGE REGULATION OF A TRANSFORMER </h1>
<br>
Voltage regulation is the measure of how well a transformer can maintain constant secondary voltage given a constant primary voltage and wide variance in load current. The lower the percentage (closer to zero), the more stable the secondary voltage and the better the regulation it will provide.

<b>This program calculates and plots the voltage regulation of a transformer as a function of load for power factors of 0.19 lagging, 1.0, and 0.19 leading.</b>
